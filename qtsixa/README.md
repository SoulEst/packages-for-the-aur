QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager

It can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3 and Keypads) to a Linux-compatible machine.

Currently it supports Sixaxis buttons, axis, accelerometers, LEDs, and, rumble.

QtSixA also registers the Sixaxis and Keypad's MAC/ID in the joystick name (ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".)

This package is based off QtSixA 1.5.1 and is patched to support systemd (plus bring it up to Arch Linux's current state).

Many thanks go to maandree for the major patches to the software, [maggu2810][6] for the service file (and [yck][7] for pointing it out).
