QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager

It can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3 and Keypads) to a Linux-compatible machine.

Currently it supports Sixaxis buttons, axis, accelerometers, LEDs, and, rumble.

QtSixA also registers the Sixaxis and Keypad's MAC/ID in the joystick name (ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".)

This package is based off QtSixA 1.5.1 and is patched to support systemd (plus bring it up to date).

Many thanks go to [yimm][2], [QXQ][6], [kode54][7] and [maandree][3] for the major patches to the software, [maggu2810][7] for the udev rules files and the service file (and [yck][8] for pointing it out).
